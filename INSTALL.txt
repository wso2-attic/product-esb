System Requirements
=======================
1. Minimum memory - 2GB
2. Java 1.7 or higher
3. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
4. To compile and run the sample clients, an Ant version is required. Ant 1.7.0
   version is recommended
5. To build WSO2 ESB from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have
   JDK 1.7 version or later and Maven 3.0.4 or later
