<h1>Version 5.0.0</h1>
<h2>About WSO2 ESB </h2>
<p>WSO2 ESB is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Enterprise Service Bus
(ESB) available under the Apache Software License v2.0. WSO2 ESB allows
administrators to simply and easily configure message routing, intermediation,
transformation, logging, task scheduling, load balancing, failover routing,
event brokering, etc.. The runtime has been designed to be completely
asynchronous, non-blocking and streaming based on the Apache Synapse core.</p>

<p>WSO2 ESB 5.0.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">Carbon platform</a>
(Middleware a' la carte), and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the
better modularity for your SOA architecture. This also contains a lots of new
features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, this ESB can be
customized to your SOA needs.</p>
<h2>About WSO2 Carbon </h2>
<p>WSO2 Carbon is a component based Enterprise SOA platform. The
design of
WSO2 Carbon focuses on separating the key functionality of the SOA
platform
into separate pluggable Carbon components that can be mixed and
matched, like
customizable building blocks. This allows you to add only the
functionality
you need to start up, and continue to add product capabilities
as your
requirements grow. This helps a business to quickly adapt to
changes.</p>
<p>OSGi is used as the underlying core modularization technology
to build the
Carbon platform. The Carbon framework is shipped with Eclipse Equinox
by
default, but can be supported on Spring dm Server, Felix or Knoplerfish
if
required. The OSGi technology even allows you to write your business
functionality as an OSGi component and deploy it in the existing Carbon
platform. </p>
<p> For a quick start on using the WSO2 Carbon
platform, the Carbon components are pre-assembled into the following
products: </p>

</ul> 
<p>You can assemble your own products by combining
components and
deploying them in a preferred architecture. </p>
<p>The WSO2 Carbon platform gives maximum flexibility to adapt
the middleware
to your enterprise architecture, rather than adapt your architecture to
the
middleware. </p>
