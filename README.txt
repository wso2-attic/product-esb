                        WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus 5.1.0
================================================================================

Welcome to the WSO2 ESB 5.1.0 release

WSO2 ESB is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Enterprise Service Bus
(ESB) available under the Apache Software License v2.0. WSO2 ESB allows
administrators to simply and easily configure message routing, intermediation,
transformation, logging, task scheduling, load balancing, failover routing,
event brokering, etc.. The runtime has been designed to be completely
asynchronous, non-blocking and streaming based on the Apache Synapse core.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon
components.

Key Features of WSO2 ESB
==================================

1. Proxy services - facilitating synchronous/asynchronous transport, interface
   (WSDL/Schema/Policy), message format (SOAP 1.1/1.2, POX/REST, Text, Binary),
   QoS (WS-Addressing/WS-Security) and optimization switching (MTOM/SwA).
2. API facilitating building REST services.
3. Non-blocking HTTP/S transports based on Apache HttpCore for ultrafast
   execution and support for thousands of connections at high concurreny with
   constant memory usage.
4. Built in Registry/Repository, facilitating dynamic updating and reloading
   of the configuration and associated resources (e.g. XSLTs, XSD, WSDL,
   Policies, JS, Configurations ..)
5. Easily extendable via custom Java class (mediator and command)/Spring
   mediators, or BSF Scripting languages (Javascript, Ruby, Groovy, etc.)
6. Built in support for scheduling tasks using the Quartz scheduler.
7. Load-balancing (with or without sticky sessions)/Fail-over, and clustered
   Throttling and Caching support
8. WS-Security, Caching & Throttling configurable via
   (message/operation/service level) WS-Policies
9. Lightweight, XML and Web services centric messaging model
10. Support for industrial standards (Hessian binary web service protocol/
   Financial Information eXchange protocol and optional Helth Level-7 protocol)
11. Enhanced support for the VFS(File/FTP/SFTP)/JMS/Mail transports with
    optional TCP/UDP transports and transport switching for any of the above
    transports
12. Support for message splitting & aggregation using the EIP and service
    callouts
13. Database lookup & store support with DBMediators with reusable database
    connection pools
14. Transactions support via the JMS transport and Transaction mediator for
    database mediators
15. Internationalized GUI management console with user/permission management for
    configuration development and monitoring support with statistics,
    configurable logging and tracing
16. JMX monitoring support and JMX management capabilities like,
    Gracefull/Forcefull shutdown/restart
17. Inbound endpoint is  a message source that can be configured dynamically.
    Inbound endpoints support all transports to work in a multi-tenant mode. 
    The behaviour of an inbound endpoint can be Polling, Busy wait or Listening 
    based on the implementation
18. Guaranteed message delivery pattern is supported with cluster coordination 
    support added to the new Message store and Message processor implementation
19. Message queueing protocol support has been extended with MQTT, RabbitMQ, Kafka
    and HL7 Inbound endpoint/transport implementations.
20. Dynamic SSL profiles support added to configure keystores dynamically without 
    even restarting the server
